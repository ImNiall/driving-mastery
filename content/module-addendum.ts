  // Alertness additions
  alertness: `

## Examples
Scenario: You are driving on a residential street with parked cars on both sides. A ball rolls into the road from between two cars. Expect a child to follow. Mirror–Brake–Assess and be prepared to stop.

## Checks for Understanding
- You should be able to identify common distraction sources and remove them before moving off.
- You should be able to adjust your scanning routine (mirrors every 5–10 seconds; near–far–side to side) for busy urban roads.
- You should be able to apply a safe response plan when a developing hazard appears (mirror checks, reduce speed, prepare to stop).

## Practice
- On your next drive, count mirror checks out loud every 5–10 seconds for two minutes; keep eyes moving near–far–left–right.
- Watch for three developing hazards (e.g., bus at a stop, brake lights ahead) and describe your response.

  // Safety Margins additions
  'safety-margins': `

## Examples
Scenario: Following an HGV in heavy spray, your visibility is reduced and stopping distances are longer. Drop back, switch on dipped headlights, and leave at least a four‑second gap.

## Checks for Understanding
- You should be able to state the two‑second rule and when to extend it (rain, night, tunnels, large vehicles).
- You should be able to explain why stopping distance grows much faster than speed.
- You should be able to adjust your following distance for wet/icy conditions and limited visibility.

## Practice
- On a dry road, verify your two‑second following distance using a fixed roadside marker.
- In rain, consciously count to four seconds and notice the increased margin.

  // Vulnerable Road Users additions
  'vulnerable-road-users': `

## Examples
Scenario (Pedestrians): At a side road, pedestrians are waiting to cross the road you’re turning into. Give way (Rule H2) and wait until the crossing is clear.
Scenario (Cyclists): You are overtaking a cyclist at 28 mph. Leave at least 1.5 metres space; wait behind if the road is narrow or visibility is poor.

## Checks for Understanding
- You should be able to describe the Hierarchy of Road Users and what it means for driver responsibility.
- You should be able to state safe passing distances and speeds for cyclists and horses.
- You should be able to plan a safe left turn when cyclists may be filtering on your left.

## Practice
- Identify three locations on a short route where vulnerable road users are likely (schools, crossings, cycle lanes) and plan your approach.
- Practise overtaking a lone cyclist on a wide road: mirror, position, 1.5 m clearance, smooth return to lane.
