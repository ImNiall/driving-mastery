## Overview
Alertness is the foundation of safe driving. The DVSA expects you to gather information continuously, predict what could happen next, and react early enough to stay in full control. You must prove this at the theory test, on the hazard perception clips, and during every practical driving lesson.

## DVSA Essentials
- **Mirror–Signal–Manoeuvre (MSM) and Mirror–Signal–Position–Speed–Look (MSPSL)** must be used before any change of speed or direction.
- Rule 90 & 91: Take planned rest stops, do not drive tired, and never use alcohol or drugs that impair alertness.
- Rule 148: Avoid distractions – mobile phone use (hand-held or hands-free) must not divert your full attention.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Continuous Observation
- Scan near, middle, and far distance plus mirrors every 5–8 seconds.
- Check blind spots before moving off, changing lanes, or turning right.
- Note pedestrian behaviour, parked vehicles, brake lights, road markings, and weather changes.

### 2. Anticipation and Planning
- Ask yourself *“What if?”* at every developing hazard (children near crossings, cyclists swerving to avoid drains, vehicles emerging from side roads).
- Adjust position and speed early. For example, ease off the accelerator when brake lights appear several vehicles ahead.
- Use road signs, temporary signals, and road surface clues to predict upcoming bends, junctions, or diversions.

### 3. Managing Distractions and Impairment
- Silence phones or store them in the glove box. Set sat-nav routes before moving.
- Recognise early fatigue signs: yawning, blinking, drifting from lane centre. Stop in a safe place at the earliest opportunity.
- Check medication leaflets for warning statements. Never drive if drowsy or impaired.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Fixating on one point:** Break tunnel vision with regular mirror checks.
- **Late hazard response:** If you frequently brake harshly, you are reacting instead of anticipating. Reduce speed sooner.
- **Driving while upset or rushed:** Build extra journey time and take time-outs if emotions affect judgment.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I automatically carry out MSM / MSPSL sequences.
- I plan my speed and position based on early hazard clues.
- My mirrors, windows, and lights are kept clean to support good visibility.
- I know personal triggers for fatigue or distraction and have strategies to manage them.

## Practice Task
>! During your next supervised drive, narrate what you can see, what might happen, and what you plan to do. This commentary driving technique trains the DVSA-standard anticipation they expect in both tests.

## Overview
Your attitude influences every driving decision. DVSA examiners look for calm, considerate behaviour that prioritises safety over convenience. Aggression, impatience, or ignoring rules is a fast route to faults or collisions.

## DVSA Essentials
- Rule 147: Be patient and courteous to other road users.
- Rule 126: Keep at least a two-second gap; increase to four seconds in the wet.
- Rule 219–221: Give emergency vehicles priority without breaking road laws.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Planning and Time Management
- Leave earlier than necessary to avoid feeling rushed.
- Use traffic reports or smart motorway signs to anticipate hold-ups.
- Accept that arriving late is better than taking risks.

### 2. Sharing Space Considerately
- Give vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders) wide clearances and do not rev or sound the horn unnecessarily.
- Allow buses and heavy goods vehicles extra room to turn or manoeuvre.
- Hold back when a driver is reversing into a space instead of squeezing past.

### 3. Managing Stress and Road Rage
- Control your breathing and keep hands relaxed on the steering wheel.
- Avoid eye contact or gestures if another driver is aggressive; do not retaliate.
- If you feel unsafe, keep doors locked, stay in your vehicle, and call the police if needed.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Tailgating:** Reduce speed gently to rebuild a safe gap if someone pressures you from behind.
- **Speeding to “keep up”:** Speed limits are maximums, not targets. Drive at a speed that fits the conditions.
- **Using headlights or horn aggressively:** Flash headlights only to warn others of your presence. Sound the horn briefly to warn, not to complain.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I keep calm under pressure and avoid retaliatory driving.
- I know the correct response when emergency vehicles approach.
- I leave enough time for every journey and never rely on aggressive shortcuts.
- I adapt my driving to protect vulnerable users every time I share the road.

## Practice Task
>! List three stressful scenarios you have experienced (for example, being cut up or being tailgated). For each, write the calm DVSA-approved response you will use next time. Review the list before your next drive.

## Overview
Safe driving starts with a safe vehicle. DVSA examiners expect you to understand essential maintenance, legal requirements, and dashboard warnings. Neglecting these can lead to fines, penalty points, or failed MOTs.

## DVSA Essentials
- Conduct regular **POWDER (Fuel, Oil, Water, Damage, Electrics, Rubber)** checks.
- Legal tyre tread minimum is **1.6 mm** across the centre three-quarters of the tyre.
- Seat belts must be worn and child seats must be compatible and correctly fitted (Rules 99–102).

## Skills to Master
### 1. Pre-Journey Checks
- Inspect tyres for tread depth, damage, and correct pressure (use the vehicle manual or door-pillar sticker).
- Confirm fluid levels: engine oil, coolant, brake fluid, and screenwash.
- Check lights, indicators, horn, wipers, and washers all work correctly.

### 2. Understanding Dashboard Warnings
- **Red lights** mean stop as soon as it’s safe; serious faults or safety risks.
- **Amber lights** signal an issue needing attention soon (e.g., engine management, ABS, low fuel).
- **Blue/green lights** indicate systems in use (e.g., high beam).

### 3. Keeping Occupants Safe
- Adjust head restraints so the top aligns with the top of your ears and sits close to the back of your head.
- Secure loose items in the cabin or boot; in a collision they can cause serious injury.
- Fit child seats to the manufacturer’s instructions and never place a rear-facing seat in front of an active airbag.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Ignoring warning lights:** Read the manual and address faults promptly.
- **Incorrect tyre pressures:** Check before long journeys or when carrying extra passengers/luggage.
- **Dirty glass or lights:** Reduces visibility; clean them regularly.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I can demonstrate the “Show Me, Tell Me” safety questions.
- I schedule regular vehicle checks and record issues.
- I know when to seek professional help (MOT, servicing, brake or steering faults).
- I understand eco-driving basics: smooth acceleration, correct gear use, and avoiding excessive idling.

## Practice Task
>! Create a weekly checklist using the POWDER routine. Complete it before your next lesson and note anything that needs fixing so you can discuss it with your instructor.

    sourceVersion: "DVSA Highway Code 2024",
    content: `
## Overview
Safety margins give you room to deal with mistakes—yours and everyone else’s. Understanding how stopping distances change keeps you out of the “no time to react” danger zone.

## DVSA Essentials
- Two-second gap in dry conditions; double to four seconds in the wet; extend to ten seconds on ice or in snow.
- Rule 126: Drive at a speed that allows you to stop within the distance you can see to be clear.
- Increase space when following large vehicles, motorcycles, or when towing.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Time-Based Gap Judging
- Use the “Only a fool breaks the two-second rule” phrase as you pass a roadside marker.
- Add more time at higher speeds, at night, or when carrying a heavy load.
- Move back if visibility is reduced by spray or glare.

### 2. Understanding Stopping Distances
- Thinking distance roughly equals 1 foot per mph (e.g., 30 mph ≈ 30 feet).
- Braking distance increases with the square of speed (doubling speed quadruples braking distance).
- Practice recalling the Highway Code stopping distance chart for theory test questions.

### 3. Adapting to Hazards
- Reduce speed before bends, dips, or humps where vision is limited.
- Watch for wet leaves, diesel spills, mud from farm vehicles, or loose gravel—all reduce grip.
- Anticipate aquaplaning in heavy rain; ease off the accelerator and avoid steering sharply.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Following at car-lengths:** Use time gaps, not physical distance.
- **Late braking downhill:** Select a lower gear early and use engine braking.
- **Ignoring weather warnings:** If signs show reduced speed limits or fog, respond immediately.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I can state the Highway Code stopping distances from memory.
- I automatically increase my following gap in poor conditions.
- I ease off accelerator and cover the brake when hazards appear ahead.
- I understand how speed, load, and road surface affect stopping distance.

## Practice Task
>! On a supervised drive, ask your instructor to quiz you on stopping distances at 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 mph while you maintain the appropriate gap. This strengthens both memory and real-world application.

## Overview
Hazard awareness is knowing what could change and how it will affect you. The DVSA hazard perception test rewards early recognition, and examiners rely on it to judge your forward planning on lessons and test day.

## DVSA Essentials
- Classify hazards: static (roundabouts, pedestrian crossings), moving (vehicles, cyclists), and developing (anything about to cause you to change speed or direction).
- Use **Mirrors → Signal → Manoeuvre (Position–Speed–Look)** every time you respond to a hazard.
- The sooner you spot a hazard, the smoother and safer your manoeuvre.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Reading the Road
- Watch for clues: brake lights, reflections in shop windows, exhaust fumes, wheel movements, and pedestrians looking over shoulders.
- Scan pavements, verges, and junctions for hidden hazards (children, dogs, delivery drivers, farm traffic).
- Interpret temporary traffic signs, cones, and flashing amber lights early.

### 2. Using Speed Wisely
- Ease off the accelerator when vision is limited; gentle deceleration gives you time.
- Cover the brake near schools, pedestrian crossings, narrow streets, and when overtaking cyclists.
- Avoid coasting in neutral; stay in gear for engine braking and better control.

### 3. Prioritising Vulnerable Road Users
- Give extra time and space to pedestrians stepping out, people with visual or hearing impairments, wheelchair users, and horse riders.
- Expect cyclists to move away from the kerb near potholes or drain covers.
- Be ready for motorcyclists filtering through traffic or emerging from blind spots.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Late mirror checks:** Build mirror checks into every hazard response.
- **Over-reliance on sat-nav:** Always confirm the road is clear before following instructions.
- **Failing to plan an escape route:** At traffic lights or junctions, leave space to manoeuvre if vehicles behind approach too fast.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I can explain what makes a hazard “developing.”
- I instinctively carry out well-timed mirror and signal routines before reacting.
- I plan early for schools, crossings, parked cars, and rural hazards.
- I understand how weather and time of day increase hazard likelihood.

## Practice Task
>! Watch two DVSA hazard perception clips. Note the moment you would click and explain what clues prompted your decision. Then practise narrating developing hazards on a real drive.

    sourceVersion: "Highway Code hierarchy update 2024",
    content: `
## Overview
The Highway Code now emphasises a hierarchy: those who can do the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce risk. Drivers must be proactive in protecting people who are more exposed.

## DVSA Essentials
- Give cyclists at least **1.5 metres** when overtaking up to 30 mph, more at higher speeds.
- Pass horse riders at no more than **10 mph** and leave at least **2 metres**.
- Be prepared to stop for pedestrians waiting to cross at junctions or zebra crossings (Rules 170 & 195).

## Skills to Master
### 1. Urban Awareness
- Approach crossings slowly and be ready to stop; scan both sides of the road for pedestrians, especially children.
- At night, expect poorly lit clothing or mobility scooters to be harder to spot.
- Watch for cyclists filtering through traffic or using advanced stop lines (bike boxes).

### 2. Rural and Suburban Considerations
- Anticipate horses, walkers, or farm vehicles. Slow early, give wide space, and avoid sudden noises.
- Look for cyclists on narrow country lanes; be patient until the road widens.
- Expect school children or buses around village centres at peak times.

### 3. Supporting Disabled and Older Road Users
- Give people with white sticks, guide dogs, wheelchairs, or walking aids extra time.
- Be patient with drivers who have disability badges; allow them more time to manoeuvre.
- Never park on dropped kerbs; they are vital crossing points for wheelchair users.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Squeezing past cyclists:** Hold back until you can overtake with the correct gap.
- **Using the horn near horses:** Only if necessary and well in advance. Otherwise pass wide and slow.
- **Blocking crossings:** Stop lines exist so pedestrians and cyclists have space—never encroach.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I apply the hierarchy of road users automatically.
- I know minimum passing distances for cyclists, horse riders, and pedestrians.
- I anticipate vulnerable users at every junction, crossing, and in rural settings.
- I show patience, even if it delays my journey.

## Practice Task
>! On your next drive, make a tally of each vulnerable road user you encounter. Note how you adapted your speed, position, and communication for each situation to discuss with your instructor.

## Overview
Not every vehicle behaves like a family car. Some swing wide to turn, some cannot stop quickly, and others operate on specialist infrastructure like tram lines. The DVSA wants you to know how to keep them – and yourself – safe.

## DVSA Essentials
- Large vehicles have extensive blind spots; if you cannot see the driver’s mirrors, they probably cannot see you.
- High-sided vehicles are susceptible to crosswinds; allow more room, especially on exposed roads or bridges.
- Trams and trolleybuses follow fixed paths and have priority; keep clear of tram lanes unless signs allow entry.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) and Buses
- Stay back at junctions so you can see their mirrors and give them room to swing.
- Never drive between an HGV and the kerb at junctions.
- Expect spray and turbulence in wet weather; increase following distance.

### 2. Agricultural Vehicles and Road Maintenance Plant
- They may travel slowly and can make wide turns into fields. Be patient and only overtake when it’s legal, safe, and you can see well ahead.
- Watch for mud on the road surface – it reduces grip and lengthens stopping distances.
- If escort vehicles accompany abnormal loads, obey their signals.

### 3. Trams, Motorcycles, and Powered Wheelchairs
- Cross tram tracks at a right angle to avoid tyre slip.
- Look twice for motorcycles; they can accelerate quickly and are easily hidden.
- Mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs can use pavements, crossings, and sometimes the road. Keep speed down and patience high.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Cutting in after overtaking a lorry:** Build a large gap before moving back in.
- **Driving on tram rails:** They are slippery, especially in wet weather. Follow road markings and signage carefully.
- **Misjudging wide loads:** If signs or escort vehicles warn of reduced width, prepare to stop and wait as directed.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I can explain how to approach large vehicles at junctions and roundabouts.
- I know the unique hazards of trams, tankers, buses, and slow-moving vehicles.
- I always leave extra space for vehicles that need room to manoeuvre.
- I remain patient when following specialist vehicles.

## Practice Task
>! Observe a busy road for five minutes. List how many different vehicle types you see and note one safety consideration for each. Then plan how you would legally and safely overtake or follow them.

## Overview
Vehicle handling is about planning ahead so your inputs are smooth and controlled. The DVSA expects you to understand what keeps the car stable – and what can make it skid – on every type of road.

## DVSA Essentials
- Slow down before corners, not during them. Brake in a straight line, steer, then accelerate gently out.
- Rule 160: Drive with both hands on the wheel where possible; steer smoothly using pull-push.
- Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) allow you to steer while braking firmly, but you should still brake progressively.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Speed, Gear, and Position Planning
- Use MSPSL: check mirrors, signal if needed, position appropriately, adjust speed, and look into the new road.
- Select a gear that provides enough engine braking when descending hills.
- Position the vehicle to maximise vision on bends without crossing centre lines.

### 2. Grip and Stability Management
- Accelerate and brake progressively; sudden inputs upset balance and reduce grip.
- Avoid harsh steering when roads are wet, icy, or covered in gravel.
- If wheels start to lose traction, ease off accelerator and avoid sharp steering corrections.

### 3. Handling Emergencies
- If ABS activates, keep pressing the pedal firmly and steer to safety.
- In a rear-wheel skid, steer in the direction of the skid (towards where the rear is sliding) to regain control.
- On flooded roads, drive slowly in low gear; test brakes gently afterwards.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Braking mid-corner:** Plan speed before the bend to keep the car balanced.
- **Riding the clutch:** Reduces control and increases wear. Use clutch only for gear changes or very low-speed manoeuvres.
- **Coasting in neutral:** Removes engine braking and reduces steering response. Stay in gear except in specific manoeuvres.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I always plan speed and gear before hazards.
- I know how ABS and other driver aids feel when they activate.
- I maintain smooth steering and avoid sudden pedal inputs.
- I can describe skid prevention and recovery techniques confidently.

## Practice Task
>! On a quiet supervised route, practise approach routines for a series of bends: mirrors, signal, position, speed, and gear before the bend, then a gentle acceleration out. Note how smooth planning keeps the car stable.

    content: `
## Overview
Motorways are statistically the safest roads, but high speeds demand precise observation and discipline. You must know the rules even before you drive on one, because questions appear in both theory and practical tests.

## DVSA Essentials
- Use the slip road to match traffic speed, signal, and merge when safe.
- Keep left unless overtaking. Use middle and right lanes only as long as needed.
- Obey variable speed limits and **never drive under a red “X”** – the lane is closed.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Joining and Leaving
- On the slip road, check mirrors and blind spots, build up speed, and find a safe gap.
- Signal early when leaving; move into the left lane in plenty of time and enter the deceleration lane at the start of the solid white line.
- If you miss your exit, carry on to the next one – never reverse or turn on the hard shoulder.

### 2. Lane Discipline and Smart Motorways
- Maintain a two-second gap (more in poor weather) at all speeds.
- Follow overhead gantry instructions: amber flashing lights warn of hazards, red X means the lane is closed.
- On all-lane-running motorways without a permanent hard shoulder, use emergency refuge areas (ERAs) for breakdowns.

### 3. Emergencies and Breakdowns
- If you break down, exit left when possible, use an ERA, and face oncoming traffic while waiting behind the barrier.
- Call National Highways from the roadside emergency phone. If you must stay in your vehicle (e.g., mobility issues), keep seatbelts on and dial 999.
- Re-join carefully once the lane is reopened or assistance arrives.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Lane hogging:** Staying unnecessarily in the middle or right lane can lead to penalties.
- **Stopping on the hard shoulder without emergency:** Only stop if instructed or in genuine emergencies.
- **Ignoring smart motorway signals:** They are legally enforceable – fines and points apply.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I understand motorway speed limits for different vehicles.
- I know what to do if I miss an exit or encounter congestion.
- I can explain red X, variable speed limits, and emergency refuge procedures.
- I maintain safe following distances and anticipate high-speed hazards.

## Practice Task
>! Watch a Highways England smart motorway briefing or practice video. Make notes on what each gantry symbol means, then quiz yourself using motorway-themed theory questions.

## Overview
The rules of the road combine legal requirements and best practice guidance. Missing a sign or misjudging priority causes most theory test mistakes. A DVSA driving examiner will expect you to apply these rules without prompting.

## DVSA Essentials
- Know speed limits: 30 mph in built-up areas (street lights unless signed otherwise), 60 mph on single carriageways, 70 mph on dual carriageways and motorways (cars).
- Give priority to vehicles from the right at roundabouts unless signs or lights show otherwise.
- Stop at solid white stop lines and red traffic signals; amber means prepare to stop unless unsafe.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Speed and Compliance
- Adjust speed for school zones, roadworks, and temporary limits.
- Understand variable limits on smart motorways and urban “20s plenty” zones.
- Use engine braking and anticipation to keep speed steady rather than braking late.

### 2. Priority and Junction Management
- At unmarked junctions, slow right down and be prepared to stop; communicate clearly.
- For mini-roundabouts, give way to vehicles on the right and do not overrun the painted circle unless unavoidable.
- At pedestrian crossings, stop before the stop line when lights show red or amber with pedestrians still crossing.

### 3. Lane Discipline and Road Markings
- Follow directional arrows and lane signs well before junctions or roundabouts.
- Understand double white lines, hatched markings, and box junction rules.
- Use bus lanes only within permitted times. Check the signs carefully.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Entering box junctions without a clear exit:** Wait until your exit is clear.
- **Forgetting to cancel indicators:** After turning or changing lanes, check and cancel signals promptly.
- **Parking where prohibited:** Respect yellow lines, zig-zags, clearways, and tram/bus stops.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I can quote national speed limits and know where to look for variations.
- I understand priority rules for junctions, roundabouts, and crossings.

## Overview
Traffic signs deliver essential instructions. Missing a sign is a common reason for theory-test errors and practical-test faults. Learn the shapes, colours, and patterns so you respond instantly.

## DVSA Essentials
- **Warning signs** are red triangles, **orders** are red circles, **information** signs are rectangles.
- Road markings (lines, arrows, box junctions, bus lanes) carry the force of law when solid or accompanied by signs.
- Traffic light sequences include steady amber (stop if safe), flashing amber at pelican crossings (give way to pedestrians), and red X for lane closures.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Recognising Sign Types
- Learn clusters: junction warnings, pedestrian/cycle alerts, speed changes, and school signs.
- Identify supplementary plates that give time or vehicle-type restrictions.
- Understand motorway diagrams: countdown markers, lane closures, service areas.

### 2. Reading Road Markings
- Solid white lines: do not cross unless safe and necessary (e.g., passing a stationary vehicle or cyclist at <10 mph if road is clear).
- Yellow box junctions: do not enter unless exit is clear; exceptions apply when turning right.
- Zig-zag lines near crossings: no stopping or parking at any time.

### 3. Signals and Smart Messaging
- Smart motorway gantries show variable limits, lane closures, and hazard warnings – follow them immediately.
- Temporary signals at roadworks may use manual control – obey site workers’ instructions.
- Police officers and traffic officers can direct you using arm signals or illuminated signs.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Ignoring supplementary plates:** They often specify times/dates for restrictions.
- **Assuming all rectangles are information:** Blue rectangles usually indicate motorway instructions; green/brown show routes and places of interest.
- **Missing temporary signs:** Look ahead for yellow background signs indicating diversions or roadworks.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I know the shapes and colours of sign categories.
- I can explain the action required for at least 30 common exam signs.
- I interpret road markings correctly, including bus lanes and cycle box rules.
- I respond promptly to smart motorway displays and traffic officer signals.

## Practice Task
>! Spend ten minutes with the “Know Your Traffic Signs” handbook (PDF or app). Pick five signs you find tricky and write a short scenario describing how you would react to each one on the road.

## Overview
Driving legally is about more than skill. The DVSA needs you to know the legal paperwork that proves you, your vehicle, and your journey are authorised. Police can request documents at any time.

## DVSA Essentials
- You must hold a valid **driving licence** for the vehicle category, keep the DVLA updated with address changes, and renew photo cards every 10 years.
- **Insurance** is mandatory. The minimum is third-party cover, and the vehicle user must be insured to drive it.
- Vehicles over three years old require an annual **MOT**, and you must tax the vehicle unless it has a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN).

## Skills to Master
### 1. Knowing Your Documents
- **V5C (log book):** Proves registered keeper, not necessarily owner. Update the DVLA when you buy, sell, or change address.
- **Insurance certificate:** Check policy type, named drivers, and class of use (social, commuting, business).
- **MOT certificate:** Valid for 12 months; driving without one (unless en route to a pre-booked test) can incur fines.

### 2. When and How to Present Documents
- If requested by police, you must produce documents immediately or within seven days at a nominated police station (“producer” or HORT/1).
- Keep digital copies but ensure originals are accessible.
- Report lost or stolen documents to the DVLA or insurer without delay.

### 3. Understanding Penalties
- Driving without insurance: up to six penalty points, unlimited fine, and potential vehicle seizure.
- False information on insurance or licence: prosecution for fraud.
- Failing to tax a vehicle can result in financial penalties and clamping.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Not updating address:** Leads to missed reminders and potential fines.
- **Assuming insurance covers everyone:** Check policy wording for named drivers and uses.
- **Forgetting MOT renewal:** Set reminders; some garages send alerts, but responsibility remains with you.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I can list the four key documents and their purpose.
- I know how to perform a SORN and when it applies.
- I understand insurance classes (social, domestic & pleasure vs. commuting vs. business).
- I know the consequences of failing to produce documents on request.

## Practice Task
>! Create a document timeline for your own or a family vehicle: note renewal dates for tax, MOT, insurance, and driving licence. Share it with the vehicle keeper to demonstrate your understanding.

## Overview
Even experienced drivers face emergencies. The DVSA expects you to stay calm, keep everyone safe, and meet legal obligations when incidents occur. Knowing the procedure reduces panic and saves lives.

## DVSA Essentials
- Use hazard lights and, where safe, a warning triangle (not on motorways).
- On smart motorways, stop in an emergency refuge area if possible and contact National Highways.
- DR ABC first aid: Danger, Response, Airway, Breathing, Circulation.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Breakdown Response
- Pull over somewhere safe, ideally a lay-by or emergency area. On a standard motorway with a hard shoulder, park as far left as possible with wheels turned left.
- Exit on the passenger side, wear high-visibility clothing if available, and wait behind the barrier.
- Use your phone or emergency phone to call for help; give accurate location details (marker posts help).

### 2. Collision Management
- Switch off engines, turn on hazard lights, and place warning triangles at least 45 metres behind (not on motorways).
- Check for injuries. If anyone is hurt, call 999. Do not move casualties unless there is immediate danger (fire, submersion).
- Exchange details (name, address, registration, insurance). Report the incident to police within 24 hours if details are not exchanged.

### 3. First Aid Basics
- DR ABC: check for danger, response, open airway, check breathing, maintain circulation with CPR if trained (30 compressions to 2 breaths).
- Control bleeding with direct pressure. Keep casualties warm and reassured.
- Do not offer food or drink. Support the head and neck if spinal injury is suspected.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Standing in the carriageway:** Always wait behind a barrier where possible.
- **Removing helmets from motorcyclists:** Only do so if it’s essential to maintain airway/breathing.
- **Leaving the scene prematurely:** Never drive away without exchanging details or reporting.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I know emergency contact procedures for motorways and smart motorways.
- I can describe DR ABC and basic CPR steps.
- I understand legal obligations when damage or injury occurs.
- I carry essential emergency kit (first aid, high-vis, warning triangle, phone charger).

## Practice Task
>! Create an emergency response card for your glovebox listing: breakdown steps, DR ABC sequence, insurance details, and important phone numbers. Review it monthly so the information stays fresh.

      "Understand legal limits for vehicle weight, passengers, towing, and nose weight",
    ],
    lastReviewed: "2025-10-15",
    sourceVersion: "DVSA Load-Securing Guidance 2024",
    content: `
## Overview
Poorly secured loads cause collisions, fines, and failed driving tests. DVSA examiners look for drivers who recognise how passengers and cargo change the way a vehicle behaves.

## DVSA Essentials
- Never exceed the vehicle’s **Maximum Authorised Mass (MAM)**; check the VIN plate.
- Spread weight evenly and keep heavy items low and central.
- Trailers and caravans must stay within the car’s towing limit and have adequate nose weight.

## Skills to Master
### 1. Preparing the Vehicle
- Adjust tyre pressures according to the handbook when carrying heavy loads or towing.
- Ensure mirrors, lights, and number plates are not obscured.
- Confirm people can enter and exit safely; do not overload seats or footwells.

### 2. Securing Loads
- Use luggage restraints, nets, or straps in the boot. Loose items can become projectiles in a collision.
- Roof racks should be tightened securely; check load limits and re-tighten straps during long journeys.
- When towing, cross safety chains (if fitted), connect breakaway cables correctly, and check lights.

### 3. Driving with Extra Weight
- Allow longer stopping distances and acceleration times.
- Take bends more slowly; higher centre of gravity increases rollover risk.
- Park on level ground when loading or unloading; set the parking brake and select first gear or park.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- **Exceeding weight limits:** Check the handbook or VIN plate; remember luggage plus passengers count.
- **Unsecured pets or luggage:** Use restraints or carriers; loose animals are dangerous.
- **Incorrect nose weight:** Excessive or insufficient nose weight leads to snaking. Follow manufacturer guidance.

## Ready-for-Test Checklist
- I know where to find my vehicle’s weight and towing limits.
- I secure all loads, including small items, before driving.
- I adjust tyre pressures and headlight aim when carrying heavy loads if required.
- I adapt my driving style to the extra weight or trailer.

## Practice Task
>! Before your next family trip, plan the load: list items, their approximate weight, and where they will go. Decide how you will secure them and what adjustments (tyre pressure, mirrors, speed) you will make.
